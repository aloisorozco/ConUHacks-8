# Sight Sense: Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired using ML and Computer Vision
**Created by Alois Orozco, Daniel Grimut, Dom Doesburg, Augusto Moto Pinheiro**

## What is Sight Sense:
For ConuHacks 8, Quebec's largest Hackathon of the past decade, our team created a very special tool to help out the visually impaired. We created and developed this tool to allow users to navigate their daily surroundings safely. Our smart glasses connect to earphones that alert the user of incoming hazards such as fast-moving vehicles, common household obstacles, etc.

## How we did it:
Our team used a pretrained computer vision model and fed it a variety of images to enhance its detection of hazardous objects for this specific purpose. We used Python and OpenCV to work with the model, enhance it, and translate them to audio cues for the visually impaired.

## Why we did it:
Our team cares passionately about making the world a better place. Through our years working together in academic projects, we have discussed our motives behind pursuing Computer Science and we all strongly believed in the great opportunities that software development has to make people's lives better.
